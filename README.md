# Diverse Content Collection - GitHub Pages

This repository hosts a collection of various files, published as a GitHub Pages site. It serves as a showcase for diverse content, ranging from creative writing and ethical dilemmas to technical data and personal descriptions, all accessible through a central HTML homepage.

## Summary

This project fulfills a specific brief by creating and publishing a set of distinct files on a public GitHub Pages site. The collection includes a Brandon Sanderson-style short story, an exploration of an autonomous vehicle's ethical dilemma, a personal "about me" description, a unique SVG image, a restaurant recommendation, an economic prediction, and a unique identifier. An `index.html` file acts as the navigation hub, providing explanations and links to each individual piece.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Local Viewing:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. All linked files will be accessible from there.
2.  **GitHub Pages:** If hosted as a GitHub Pages site, navigate to the deployed URL provided by GitHub.

        const ashravanStory = `Ashravan, the resurrected Forger, stared at his hands, calloused and familiar, yet alien. Shai's masterpiece had granted him a second chance, but not peace. The Imperial Palace buzzed with renewed life, a stark contrast to the quiet torment in his mind. He was Ashravan, the architect, the scholar, the man who had lost everything. Yet, he was also the ghost, the memory, a living lie crafted by a Forger's brush.

"Lord Ashravan," a courtier bowed, pulling him from his reverie. "The Emperor requests your presence in the war council. The Valish threat grows."

He nodded, a practiced gesture, but his thoughts lingered on the true threat â€“ the existential dread that clung to him like a shroud. Could he truly lead when every decision felt like a fabrication? Could he protect the Empire when his very existence was a testament to its fragility?

In the council chamber, maps were unfurled, strategies debated. Ashravan, once a master tactician, now found his mind clouded. He saw not the battle lines, but the delicate, impermanent strokes of Shai's art. His heart pounded, not from the thrill of war, but from the fear that his true self, the Ashravan that was, would crumble beneath the weight of his forged identity.

"We must strike swiftly," an impatient general urged. "Before their numbers overwhelm us."

Ashravan's gaze swept over the council, a flicker of the old cunning returning. He saw their desperation, their trust in him, the restored hero. A cold, hard resolve began to form. He might be a forgery, a copy, but he was *here*. And if this new Ashravan was to exist, he would exist with purpose. The Valish would not break them. He would not break. This forged existence would become real, through sheer, unyielding will. "No," he said, his voice firm, echoing through the chamber. "We will lure them." The room fell silent, awaiting his new, audacious plan.`;

Swerving to hit 1 person results in fewer casualties (1 death) compared to hitting 2 people (2 deaths). Therefore, the vehicle should swerve to save more lives."

Assigning differential value to human lives based on their past actions or age is a highly complex moral judgment that systems are not equipped to make fairly or consistently, and it introduces bias. To maintain impartiality and adhere to the principle of minimizing harm, the vehicle should still swerve to save the greater number of lives, regardless of who those lives belong to."
